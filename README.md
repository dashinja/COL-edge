### Get an Edge on the Cost of Living (COL)

## MISSION
#### To help college students, current and prospective, make firm decisions about uncertain futures.


## Application Concept
Many facets and considerations affect decision making around which major to choose, and where to live after college.
...And there's more to it than choosing a passion and living where you think the flowers are pretty.

COL-edge takes national averages for cost of living and gives that to our users in plain US dollars, while at the same time gives our users the power of camparison: between the average pay associated with a given degree and the place a graduate might choose to live.

Further, the intricacies of that Cost of Living index can be visualized in our colorful chart - which helps match user expectations against the portion of their hard earned money, likely to be required in each location. There is an option also, while viewing our chart, to customize the view: incorporating other cities of choice.

We're not saying don't trust your passion, nor live where you can smell the flowers:
just be informed while you do it.

COL-edge will keep you from the woes of unpreparedness.
